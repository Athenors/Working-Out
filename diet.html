      <h2>1. Make sure to hit calorific goals</h2>
      <p>
        Whether you're trying to gain/lose weight or maintain, getting the
        sufficient calories is necessary for proper brain and body functioning.
        According to the nhs women should intake 2k calories a day while men
        should intake 2.5k. Tracking calories is very useful and I suggest using
        an application such as myfitnesspal.

      <h2>2. Eat after you exercise</h2>
      <p>
        Make sure to eat after you exercise so that your body can use the
        nutrients for your muscles to recover. It is recommended that you eat a
        meal high in protein and carbohydrates within 2 hours.
      </p>

      <h2>3. Eat Snacks!</h2>
      <p>
        The majority of people can enjoy a few little snacks before and after
        exercise. How you feel is important. Do what suits you best. Snacks
        consumed shortly before exercise are unlikely to provide you with extra
        energy if your session is less than 60 minutes, but they may help you
        avoid disorienting hunger sensations. If your workout lasts longer than
        60 minutes, it may be beneficial to consume something high in
        carbohydrates before, during, or after the activity. Suitable snack
        choices include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Energy Bar</li>
        <li>Fruits such as a Banana</li>
      </ul>
